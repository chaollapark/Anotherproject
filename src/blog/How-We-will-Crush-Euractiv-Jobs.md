## Understanding Euractiv Jobs and Its Market Position

### The TLDR of our winning the EU institutions vacancies market in Brussels
Dominate through scale is the name of the game. Our core game is to use our 11 job boards to subsidize the Brussels vacancies environment, use SEO research and technology to make job opportunities a market where Euractiv cannot compete. This plan includes controlling prices, aggressively going after clients in the European Union consultancies and by courting young people by outranking our competition.

### What is Euractiv Jobs?
Euractiv jobs was a key player in the vacancies market for the public affairs and European affairs market. At its hay days it finance(d) 10% of Euractiv's revenue. In fact, it used to be a innovation - Brussels used to not have many job boards.  
However now Jobs euractiv is a old website that is falling apart and can barely hold vacancies.

### Key Strengths of Euractiv Jobs
10 years ago when the European Union was growing rapidly and policy professionals were flocking to work in the European Commission to write policy briefs, special reports, and do other work or member states it was a total innovation. Right now the only strength it has is the brand name the business still has.

### Identifying Gaps in Their Strategy
Neglect is the main problem the euroactive jobs job suffers. To remake the website Euractiv would need to spend some 20k plus a SEO specialist. Which would be the smart development strategy - especially because it's the most efficient part of the euractiv business - but before they realize the need to fix this we'll already have made it too painful for them to compete with us.

## The Game Plan: How We’ll Outperform Euractiv Jobs

### Building a Better User Experience
Our website outperforms in every criteria that exists. Not only do our vacancies have better graphics, our website loads faster. Also, we cater to specific industries like health, energy, trade and agriculture through our platform.  
Moreover, euroactiv jobs and the whole euractiv team doesn't have a lobbyist or public affairs specialists - their key vacancies posters - while we have a cofounder that was a advocacy professional for 9 years.

### Offering Competitive Advantages
Being a tech based startup that doesn't rely on our job board to get revenue we will always outperform Euractiv in prices.  
Also, surprisingly euractive jobs doesn't have special reports or a yearly special report to keep it's employment platform relevant. Lastly, we'll always be able to subsidize our business in Brussels with our other 11 job boards that cover vacancies in all the public affairs hubs in the world (and member states).

### Leveraging SEO and Digital Marketing
Jobs euractiv doesn't protect any of it's keywords. That is words people search on google that bring clicks and traffic to their job opportunities. Actually the terms: Euractiv jobs, Euroactive jobs, Euroactiv jobs, Euractive jobs, and jobs euractiv, which should be part of their brand aren't even written about. This means that potentially eujobs.co could outrank euractiv on their own keyword and name.
