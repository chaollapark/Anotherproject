# How Much Money Does EuroBrussels Make?

EuroBrussels, one of the oldest job boards for policy-related positions, was founded in 2001. Specializing in EU jobs, it also posts vacancies in the legal and communications fields, and even has a sister site for international relations roles.

Last month alone, EuroBrussels posted around 70 vacancies, each listing priced between 1000 and 2000 euros. Estimating revenue, EuroBrussels likely generated approximately 70,000 euros in that month. On an average month, however, the platform may bring in closer to 100k. Surprisingly, despite being an established job board, it lacks social media presence, has minimal digital features like uniform icons, and relies on a sluggish payment process.

### Why Does the European EuroBrussels Community Accept a Subpar Job Board?
EU policy professionals, along with EU institutions, focus on legislative work, research monitoring, and networking. The lack of a competitive alternative or improved system means that users settle for what is available. In niche markets like international relations or public affairs careers, monopolies or limited options are common, often leading to a less-than-ideal user experience.

### What Are My Goals with EUJobs.com and How Will I Compete?
My primary goal with **EUJobs.com** is to develop software that serves the entire lobbying industry, with job listings as just one component of the larger European Union and European Affairs ecosystem. Ultimately, I envision the job board as a loss leader â€” a tool that allows us to upsell our core services. Each successful vacancy we fill builds our reputation and strengthens connections with lobbying firms, trade associations, and EU institutions.

Every government affairs hub has job openings, making this model highly scalable. Though we plan to generate initial revenue from job listings, our long-term focus will shift toward our SaaS product.

### Competing in Vacancies: Our Strategic Advantage
For EuroBrussels or any competitor to challenge us, they would need to reduce prices drastically to push us out of the market. Our strategy, however, revolves around creating a sustainable ecosystem around job listings. We aim to leverage the stable income from job listings to support the growth of our SaaS product. Our expansion plan includes targeting Brussels, EU institutions, and the other 11 hubs for international relations.

### Future Goals: Funding and Market Expansion
Once we achieve strong product-market fit, we will seek financing through a seed or Series A round to fund our expansion. This will help us build a robust ecosystem for our products, reinforcing our competitive edge.

In conclusion, our ecosystem approach is designed to sustainably support our SaaS product, expand into key European hubs, and eventually become a dominant player in the EU lobbying and government affairs sector.
