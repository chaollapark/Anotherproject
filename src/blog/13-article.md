Zmanic aims to bring software to lobbying, and later the government contract or tender industry.  
So how does this work with a job search/career website (or as the Flemish would say "een job" website)?

Job opportunities and career or job search(ing) seem like totally different fields to lobbying, and it's kind of true.  
The question we asked ourselves is "who writes the een job alert for the job"? Lobbyists (a partner if it's a small firm) or an HR person (if it's a huge firm). So what is there "te gaan" (to gain)?

The idea is that once we get the job market cornered, we'll be able to use our jobsite(s) to create automatic leads. Moreover, we'll be able to leverage our profits from the job sites to gain an advantage over our competitors.

## OP DE - Operation Deutsche Bahn

Or operation "German Train" is the idea that while our competitors all fight the monitoring fight—there are over 40 monitoring companies—we will get stable revenue with our jobsite(s), and we can build a strong position from which to nibble away at the fragmented market.

In fact, once we get a stable revenue source, we won't need to worry about competition, and we can try out-raise other startups and/or buy monitoring companies if needed.

## The End Goal of Our Jobsite

In the end, of course, our goal is to consolidate the lobbying market and be the main software provider.  
Our jobsite, though useful for revenue, is just a lead machine through which we can reach job search(ers) and the people who write the career descriptions (lobbyists).
