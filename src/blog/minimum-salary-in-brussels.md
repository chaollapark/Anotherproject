## What Is the Minimum Salary in Belgium?

Belgium, like many EU countries, has a **national minimum wage**, but it doesn’t vary much by region, so the same minimum wage applies in Brussels. As of **2024**, the national **minimum gross wage** in Belgium is approximately **€1,955.88 per month** for full-time employees aged 18 and above.

This wage is regularly adjusted based on **indexation** to ensure it keeps up with the cost of living and inflation. Indexation is a mechanism used by the Belgian government to adjust wages, pensions, and benefits to maintain purchasing power as prices increase.

Here’s a breakdown of how the minimum wage is applied across different age groups:

- **Workers aged 18 and older**: €1,955.88/month
- **Workers aged 19 with 6 months of service**: €2,037.08/month
- **Workers aged 20 with 12 months of service**: €2,107.67/month

These numbers reflect the **gross salary**, meaning that deductions for taxes and social security contributions will reduce the amount of take-home pay. Typically, net pay after these deductions is around **65% to 70%** of the gross salary.

## Minimum Salary in Different Sectors in Brussels

While the national minimum wage applies across all sectors, many industries in Brussels offer salaries well above the legal minimum. Here’s a look at some of the sectors that attract international workers to the city and the salary ranges they offer.

### 3. **Private Sector Jobs: Lobbying and Public Affairs**

The private sector in Brussels, particularly **lobbying** and **public affairs**, offers some of the most competitive salaries in the city. Many companies and consultancy firms are based here due to Brussels’ political importance.
