When most people think of international careers in Brussels, the conversation typically revolves around **EU jobs**.

These opportunities may not receive the same level of attention as EU jobs, but for those interested in international diplomacy, development, and global governance, **UN vacancies in Brussels** offer unique and fulfilling career paths.

## A Growing but Overlooked Market

## Types of UN Jobs Available in Brussels

The **UN jobs in Brussels** span several agencies and programs.

## How UN Jobs Differ from EU Jobs

While **EU jobs** in Brussels are often administrative, focusing on European policies, laws, and governance, **UN jobs in Brussels** operate on a different scale.
