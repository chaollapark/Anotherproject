**Eujobs.co** is a platform dedicated to listing job opportunities. Our business may be centered on vacancies, but jobs aren’t the ultimate purpose of life. Let’s look at some numbers: on average, a person will work 36.9 years. Given a life expectancy around 80 years in the developed world, that’s nearly half a lifetime spent working.

## Questions to Ponder at Job Fairs
Whenever I attend a job fair, I find myself asking:
- Do I really want to work for the rest of my life?
- Why are we all working? Is it simply to survive?
- Is life just about work?
- Is "work from home" the best alternative?

While work provides structure and meaning, especially for the young audience that frequently visits our site, I believe we should also consider creating our own "job opportunities." Yes, remote work has its perks, but imagine working for yourself, on your terms.

### A "Life Athlete" and the Value of Health
I’ve come across Bryan Johnson, a multi-millionaire with a bold vision to live indefinitely — or, as he calls it, to be a "life athlete." He’s investing enormous resources into staying healthy and, in a sense, building his own "job opportunities" for the long haul. Though unconventional, he has some compelling arguments for health, balance, and self-driven goals.

Johnson suggests that:
- The best way to test the value of your time is by creating something of your own.
- A longer, healthier life can expand your job opportunities and allow you to advance your career meaningfully.
- From my perspective, 10 sales can cover someone’s salary. So, why not consider if a simple website or self-driven project could provide you with a living?

### The Takeaway: Define Your Life Beyond Jobs
Yes, attend job fairs. Yes, work remotely if it suits you. But remember, time is limited. Whatever you choose to pursue, remember that work isn’t everything. You need a written goal that gives your life direction — not just something broad like “being happy” but a concrete aim that drives you forward. Even if you don’t achieve it, the journey itself adds purpose and meaning to your life.

In the end, jobs are just one part of life. The true challenge lies in creating something fulfilling that aligns with your vision.
