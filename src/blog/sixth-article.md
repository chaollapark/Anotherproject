Euractiv Jobs, short for Euroactive Jobs, is one of the oldest job boards in Brussels. It was created by the former CEO of Euractiv, someone our team deeply admires because he can sell, program, and write really well.

Unfortunately, Euroactive Jobs isn't a maintained website. The new owners of Euroactive Jobs have decided that the best way to make money is to abandon their jobs website and focus on their subscription—in the hopes of competing with Politico.

This leaves their job website vulnerable.

Our website is better than theirs because we can offer:

1. **Immediate online payment** compared to Jobs Euractiv's bank transfer (which takes 48 hours);
2. **Better optimized website**, which attracts more viewers, also because we have taken possession of their keywords such as "Euroactiv Jobs," "Euroactive Jobs," and "Euractive Jobs";
3. **A better price** than Jobs Euractiv— instead of their 1000 euro offer, we charge 200 euros—which takes the "euro" away from Euroactiv Jobs.

## How We'll Always Offer a Better Service Than Euractiv Jobs

The inherent nature of our startup, which is trying to be the principal software provider for lobbyists, means we will always use the best technology available and we can also directly iterate on our products.

How does that compare with Euroactiv Jobs (or Euractiv Jobs)?

1. While the Euractiv Jobs team will always have to outsource their development to second parties, we'll always immediately make our product better (in a sense, being more active than "Euractive Jobs");
2. Our revenue comes from job listings. Euroactive Jobs is actively trying to make "euros," while we want to expand our brand recognition and create a friendly environment where people trust our SaaS product—in short, we'll always be cheaper than Jobs Euractiv.

### In the End, We're More Active Than Euroactive Jobs

We find all the efficiencies and we'll always give you a better offering. The best evidence of this is how we own the search terms "Euroactiv Jobs," "Euroactive Jobs," "Euractive Jobs," and "Jobs Euractiv."

Moreover, in terms of job boards for EU policy, government affairs, and public affairs, we have the best employment, networking, and reach. Hopefully, in the future, some EU leaders will remember how they got their first job on our website.
