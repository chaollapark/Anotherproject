## Redefining Brussels Employment Opportunities
The job space in Brussels is defined by three different hiring practices. For executives, most of the time specialized headhunters are employed - these people get 10% to 20% of the yearly salary of the hire as a bonus, but their cost is covered by the high value of the hire.  
Then there is the coffee interview method, where a job is published on the vacancies section of the company, but some people get fast-tracked to the interview stage through an informal coffee interview.  
Lastly, there is the job board scene. Many companies publish their positions on job boards like eujobs (EU jobs), Eurobrussels, or Euractiv jobs (also written Euroactive jobs).

### The Changing Landscape of Brussels Employment
How the job market in Brussels is evolving. Because of the non-sexy nature of lobbying and public affairs, not many companies or technically savvy people have attempted to enter the market. This led to huge technical gaps in the government affairs market. Old players like Jobs Euractiv, EU Jobs, and Eurobrussels are still using technology from 2001.  

The growing demand for modern platforms to support Brussels employment is evident - that's why we decided to enter the market of job vacancies.

### The Role of Euractiv Events and Networking in Job Success
In our impact assessment, we studied how leveraging opportunities like **Euractiv events** to connect talent with employers is key. But we also realized that we need to use social media to dethrone entrenched players.  
Our first strategy is building a community around Brussels-based careers. The other is honesty. In fact, some of our competitors lie about their viewer numbers, and instead of counting their views on their site, they count the number of people who looked at their link on Google. This is an unfair practice (yes, we're looking at you Jobsinbrussels (Jobs in Brussels - one of the big competitors)).

## 10 Ways We’ll Compete with Jobs in Brussels

1. **Offering a Modern Platform for Brussels Employment**  
   - We are all coders, that is programmers, so our UI/UX focuses on a user-friendly platform that streamlines job searching and recruitment.

2. **Catering to Diverse Industries**  
   - Focusing on sectors like public affairs, health, law, and sustainability is important. But we divided our job boards into different segments that are separate.

3. **Leveraging Euractiv Events for Outreach**  
   - Engaging with top talent and employers at key events like **Euractiv events** is one of our key points. As YC founders say, we recruit people for job vacancies in ways that don't scale - every time we see someone and they ask us what we do, we show them our website. This is a perfect way to see how they use our website and identify what to fix.

4. **Providing Targeted Job Listings**  
   - Ensuring listings cater to Brussels employment niches, from internships to senior roles, is one of our major challenges. Unlike our competitors, we post jobs in Brussels with SEO optimization.

5. **Enhancing Employer and Candidate Experience**  
   - Simplifying the recruitment process with advanced tools and technology is another key strategy we employed. For example, we have an AI tool that sifts through all our CVs and gives employers various options to filter CVs, so the tedious job of reading is easier.

6. **Driving SEO and Online Visibility**  
   - Outranking competitors for key Brussels employment-related search terms is, surprisingly, the easiest thing we did. In two months, we escaped the Google sandbox for job vacancies, which is an incredible feat!

7. **Building Trust with Local Employers**  
   - Developing relationships with companies and institutions in Brussels. Partnerships are another way we are building community and traction - in fact, this is the most efficient way we are beating other Jobs in Brussels websites.

8. **Integrating Career Development Resources**  
   - Offering guidance, tips, and industry insights to job seekers on LinkedIn is another key tactic we employ. We find it much better than lying to job posters about our numbers. Also, having an empty LinkedIn page with 60,000 followers is useless if they don’t interact with your posts.

9. **Hosting Events to Complement Euractiv Events**  
   - Creating our own networking and hiring events to connect employers and candidates is a third strategy we are employing (it's something the book *Traction* suggests - though not explicitly for job vacancies).

10. **Innovating Continuously to Stay Ahead**  
    - Adapting to changes in the Brussels employment market with constant updates and improvements is something we haven't thought of much yet. The job vacancies market needs more impact assessments; we need to understand what other products we can build.

## The Future of Brussels Employment

### Collaboration Between Platforms and Events
- How job boards and events like **Euractiv events** will shape the future of recruitment. Especially since we don't think the Euractiv jobs site will be feasible for Euractiv in 2 to 3 years. We are also collaborating with sites like Aaronmcloughlin.com - the best blogging website in Brussels.

### A Commitment to Excellence in Brussels Employment
These are our two promises for job vacancies:  
- Our dedication to providing the best opportunities for job seekers and employers alike will never fade.  
- Innovation and adaptability will keep us competitive in the Brussels employment market. We will never forget that.

In conclusion, our services will always be better than competitors' because we have 12 job boards and a SaaS product. We can subsidize our job boards because they bring leads to our other products. We are not a job vacancies company, and because our job portion of the business isn't the profit center, it will always be better than our competitors'.
