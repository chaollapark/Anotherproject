- **Permanent Staff:** Permanent positions generally come with long-term benefits and more stability, and can earn salaries on the higher end of the scale.

Getting a position within an **EU institution** usually requires passing competitive exams, organized by the **European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO)**, and the competition for these positions can be intense.

### 3. NGOs and Non-Profit Organizations

While Brussels is a key location for **NGOs** and non-profit organizations focused on **policy advocacy**, **human rights**, and environmental issues, the salaries tend to be lower than in the private sector or **EU institutions**. However, these roles are known for their meaningful impact on global and European policy.

## Is Your Salary Good Enough? Key Factors to Consider

Determining whether your salary is good enough depends on several factors:

### 1. Sector and Role

Salaries vary significantly depending on the sector. For instance, working in an **EU institution** or **EU agency** often offers higher salaries and better benefits than working for an **NGO** or smaller consultancy. Positions in **public affairs** also tend to offer more competitive salaries compared to non-profit sectors.

### 2. Experience and Seniority

Experience and seniority play a major role in salary levels. **Junior roles** tend to offer lower salaries but can still cover basic living costs in Brussels. However, mid-level and senior roles, especially in **public affairs** or **EU institutions**, can offer significantly higher compensation.

### 3. Additional Benefits

Many positions in Brussels, particularly in **EU institutions** or **EU agencies**, offer benefits like **healthcare**, **pension contributions**, and **expat benefits**. These perks add considerable value to your overall compensation package and may offset higher living costs in the city.

### 4. Lifestyle Choices

Your lifestyle choices also impact what salary is "good" for you. For instance, living in the city center, dining out frequently, or traveling often may require a higher salary to sustain that lifestyle. Conversely, living in a more affordable area outside the center and budgeting more carefully can make a lower salary more manageable.

## Conclusion: What’s a Good Salary in Brussels?

For most professionals working in **EU institutions**, **EU agencies**, or **public affairs**, a salary of **€3,500 to €4,500 per month** provides a comfortable standard of living in Brussels.
