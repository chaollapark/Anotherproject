What Euractiv jobs should do, right now, is hire us for their SEO. Despite covering EU policies, Prime Minister Meloni, and other policy affairs, they haven’t protected their "name" — Euractiv.

### What Does "Not Protecting Euractiv" Mean?
Not protecting Euractiv means that with minimal effort, a small company like mine could outrank Euractiv jobs when someone searches for "Euractiv," "euroactive jobs," or any other derivative of their name. The first thing anyone does when building a website is analyze the environment and competition.

This analysis involves identifying relevant keywords, i.e., assessing how much traffic phrases like "jobs Euractiv" or "European Union" bring to a website. SEO tools can reveal the traffic-driving words that aren’t frequently used on the site, allowing newer websites to target these keywords to divert attention from competing websites.

Usually, this strategy involves writing articles embedded with keywords, but not so heavily that it triggers artificial intelligence warnings — as Google’s policies punish exploitative digital marketing strategies.

### An Example of Keyword Optimization
Since Brussels hosts the European Commission, Public Affairs consultancies, and countless NGOs, many of the keywords for Euractiv jobs aren't limited to "vacancies," "job opportunities," and "careers." They also extend to topics such as government, finance, trade, and Euractiv’s core business — journalism.

If you hadn’t noticed, my last paragraph was intentionally filled with public affairs terms and keywords frequently searched by individuals working in EU institutions. This article itself acts as a meta-commentary on keyword usage, attempting to communicate through keywords to promote my website and sustain growth, which is valuable for investment research and venture capital.

Although I haven’t deliberately pushed keywords like "Emmanuel Macron" or "European Parliament," this article includes enough relevant terms to make an impact on Euractiv jobs’ vacancies (hopefully more companies will start posting job opportunities on my website).

### A Surprising Lack of SEO Optimization
It’s surprising that a media company, which should have access to technology consultants, hasn’t optimized their website better.

### Why Is This Article So Poorly Written — Do I Need Better Talent?
The quality of articles around keywords like "vacancies" and "job opportunities" is non-existent. By simply producing a first draft like this one, filled with secondary keyword references to "vacancies" and "job opportunities," I could gain a significant edge. Ideally, the next time someone searches for "Vacancies" or "Euroactiv jobs," they won’t land on an article about the European Council or agriculture policy but instead find **eujobs.co** with listings for jobs in law, energy, health, and even senior management roles.

Writing policy briefs can be enjoyable, but stuffing an article with European affairs-centric keywords while keeping sentences coherent is much more entertaining. This could be a job in itself! Perhaps, the next vacancies I post won’t be for NGOs or human rights roles but for an SEO writer!
