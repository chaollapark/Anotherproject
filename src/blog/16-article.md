# Jobs in Brussels or Employment in Brussels is a Huge Business

In the EU jobs sector alone, websites like "Jobs in Brussels" or "EuroBrussels" generate over 10k every month. Currently, Euractiv jobs has 68 listings. Without any guaranteed successful candidates and minimal administrative support, Euractiv earned over 50k just this month.

### Recruiting Senior Management Roles: The Costs and Justifications
Recruiting for senior management or key roles typically results in a flat fee between 10% and 20% of the successful candidate's salary. While substantial, this fee is justifiable — recruiters often have to call hundreds of candidates to find the right fit. Matching the right person with the right role is no small task!

### Sustainability of Sites like Eurojobs Brussels or Jobs in Brussels
These websites, including Jobs in Brussels and EuroBrussels, collectively generate over 2 million annually, all with minimal management, little overhead, and barely any technological infrastructure. This raises a question: how sustainable is this approach?

### The Eurojobs Brussels Market is Stagnant
Senior management teams already spend upwards of 20k to secure the right candidates and are comfortable paying established sites like Jobs in Brussels or EuroBrussels for their listings. So, how will EU jobs differentiate itself from these incumbents?

### Innovating Through Diversification and Better Technology
The key to competing in this space lies in product diversification and technological advancements. Sustainable development must align with technological progress, especially through targeted ads, SEO, and other scaling strategies.

For every "European jobs Brussels" advertisement on Google, we plan to A/B test multiple variations, which will not only increase visibility among senior management but also improve our rate of securing successful candidates. Technology is critical in making this process efficient.

Our competitors, however, lack these approaches. They don’t use tracking ads, LinkedIn ads, or have technical experts in key roles, limiting their capacity for improvement.

### Suggestions for Competitors to Do the Right Job
If I could offer our competitors some advice, it would be this: start buying ads, lower prices, and build more efficient systems. Websites like Euractiv jobs, Jobs in Brussels, and EuroBrussels currently rely on bank transfers only, without an online payment system. Imagine the administrative time lost on emails, job posting approvals, and bank transfer confirmations. These inefficiencies impose additional costs on the management teams of companies needing to fill key roles. Can we honestly say that this setup is doing the right job?

### In Conclusion: Another SEO Article
